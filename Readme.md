# Data_Science_Certifications_Krishna_Babu 

This repository showcases my foundational skills in Data Science, AI, and AWS through a curated collection of my certifications. To ensure the security and privacy of my credentials, I have chosen to store the certificates in secure way to balance sharing my achievements with protecting my privacy.

**How to Access Certifications:**

* **Resume:**  My resume, provides links to my certifications which are publicly accessible.
* **GitHub Repository:** This repository serves as a showcase of my credentials. While I have chosen to restrict direct access to the certificates themselves on GitHub due to security concerns.

For your convenience, I have organized my certifications into separate Google Drive folders to ensure easy access and maintain confidentiality.
